                <p>We are not only dedicated to developing expertly engineered products that provide the
                    best possible value to our clients and their enterprise processes, but also to delivering the highest
                    degree of qualified technical support and services. Supporting you on an individual basis helps ensure
                    that you can use all the software products we make successfully and with zero constraints – even years
                    after they were first installed. You can reach SoftVision Support by phone daily from 09:00 to 17:00 hours
                    (CET) and by email around the clock. Moreover, you can look forward to speaking with your personal representative,
                    not with some anonymous call center agent.</p>
                <br />
                <p>There are three levels within our support system. We award support
                    level Bronze to each of our clients with the purchase of a software license, whereas the Silver and Gold support levels are
                    reserved for members of our paid subscription program. We provide free Silver level implementation support during every
                    product evaluation phase and the first 30 days from the date the license was purchased. This is our way of guaranteeing
                    you can work with our products efficiently and effectively right from the start.</p>
